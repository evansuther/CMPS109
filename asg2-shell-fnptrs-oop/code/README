This program was completed using pair programming.
Partner: Derrick DeBose (ddebose@ucsc.edu)
Partner: Evan Suther (esuther@ucsc.edu)

We acknowledge that each partner in a programming pair should
drive roughly 50% of the time the pair is working together, and
at most 25% of an individual's effort for an assignment should
be spent working alone. Any work done by a solitary programmer
must be reviewed by the partner. The object is to work
together, learning from each other, not to divide the work into
two pieces with each partner working on a different piece.

Derrick DeBose spent   12 hours working alone.
Evan Suther spent     8 hours working alone.
We spent              20 hours working together.
Derrick DeBose        10 hours driving.
Evan Suther           10 hours driving.
